        NEWS-1 | PTI, allies will defeat no-trust move: Qureshi
    </h3>

    <p>
        MULTAN: Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Sunday said moving a no-confidence motion was a constitutional right of the opposition and the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and its allies would defeat it politically. “By hinting at a no-confidence
        move against Prime Minister Imran Khan, Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has recognised him (Khan) as the constitutional prime minister. Now (Bilawal should) stop calling him a selected prime minister,” the foreign minister
        said. He told the media that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was an unnatural alliance because of the differences of opinion among its major components — the PPP, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl.

        a balance between cases involving the ruling alliance and the opposition. In a statement, NAB chairman retired justice Javed Iqbal said the anti-graft watchdog was committed to taking mega corruption cases of the ruling alliance and the opposition
        to their logical conclusion. Without taking any name, the chairman mentioned money laundering cases of leaders of the opposition and the ruling alliance allegedly involved in the recent sugar and wheat flour crises.

        NEWS-4 | Next few months crucial for politics, says Zardari
    </h3>

    <p>
        LAHORE: Pakistan Peo­ples Party co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari has said that the next few months are very important for the future of the country’s politics. “It (the government) may commit a blunder in the current situation (and) put the country into a
        grave danger,” the PPP leader warned while speaking to Punjab PPP’s general secretary Chaudhry Manzoor by phone on Sunday. “The Pakistan Demo­cratic Movement is united and it will continue its onslaught against the government from all directions,”
        a statement issued by the party’s Punjab chapter quoted Mr Zardari as saying. The former president said it was time for the PTI government to go home as its inexperience and ineptness might plunge the country into a bigger crisis.

        NEWS-5 | Key federal entities oppose grant of licence to KP company
    </h3>

    <p>
        ISLAMABAD: The Central Power Purchasing Agency and the National Transmission & Despatch Company — both key federal entities — have opposed transmission licence to the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Transmission and Grid System Company (KPTGC) that seeks to operate
        about 7300MW of power supply system in the province over a period of five to 10 years. In response to comments sought by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) from stakeholders over the KPTGC’s request for grant of provincial
        transmission licence, the Punjab government has, however, supported the request while demanding that the proposed licence should ensure provision of minimum technical and human resource capital as and when required and the provincial transmission
        company should provide open access and participate in the wholesale electricity market.
